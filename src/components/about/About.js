      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am an engineer with a solid foundation in both frontend engineering
        and data science. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a
        Master’s in Data Science, I bring a blend of practical programming and
        analytical expertise to my work. Over three years as a frontend
        engineer, I’ve honed my skills in crafting user-friendly web
        applications using JavaScript, React, and CSS, which has enhanced my
        problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey into data science involved hands-on projects where I applied
        machine learning, statistical analysis, and data manipulation techniques
        using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and
        PyTorch. I have worked on clustering and sentiment analysis projects,
        deriving actionable insights from large datasets. I am passionate about
        leveraging my technical skills and continuous learning mindset to solve
        complex problems and create impactful solutions in a collaborative
        environment.
